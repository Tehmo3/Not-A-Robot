# What does it do?
Not A Robot logs your discord servers messages and uses probability to impersonate users in the server! It also has a bunch of other fun features such as quizzes based on these impersonations, as well as a disguise generator (image classifer generated nickname and profile picture combos).


# How do I install the bot?
1. Go to https://not-a-robot-discord.herokuapp.com/
2. Press 'ADD YOUR SERVER', log in, select your server from the drop down and press 'Authorize'.
3. Thats it! Now the bot is in your Discord server!


# NOTE: Due to ongoing upkeep costs, the bot has been moved to a free server and database. Due to this, most of the bots functionality
# will only work on a small set of servers that got in first! 

To use the bot, you need to visit https://not-a-robot-discord.herokuapp.com/ to start the server.
