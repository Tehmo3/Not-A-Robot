# What does it do?
Not A Robot is a discord bot that reads through your chat logs and then uses markov chains to generate sentences from messages sent prior in your server.


# How do I install the bot?
1. Go to https://www.not-a-bot.com/
2. Press 'ADD YOUR SERVER', log in, select your server from the drop down and press 'Authorize'.
3. Thats it! Now the bot is in your Discord server!


# NOTE: The bot is currently running on a free heroku server, meaning you need to visit not-a-bot.com to wake it up.
